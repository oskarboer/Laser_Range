# Laser_Range
This is program to count score for hand drown target and laser guns 
This is not ready yet and not user-friendly at all, but if you are still interested to try this here is simple tutorial.
1. Draw a target on white paper with a black marker, target can contain any amount of circles (or just closed areas)
2. Start Laser_range.py and point your camera at target so only paper is visible, adjust threshold so only maker is black.
3. Press space and try to "shoot" with a laser poiter, scrore system needs improvment

I'll make code more readble during next week.
